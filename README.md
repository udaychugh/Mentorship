# Mentorship

Mentorship is a fast and right way to learn and grow in your career with the help of experienced industry professionals and seniors. Programming students can use Mentorship to capture their work-based experiences and share these learning experiences with other students through text, photos, or videos. We focus on developing a platform that allows programming student to share one’s work experiences and projects with other younger students and the tech community. This platform helps in building one’s professional career right from the starting of their college days. Mentors can sell or share study materials, notes, roadmaps, lectures,  projects, conduct various kinds of interactive sessions.
